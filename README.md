Hello! I'm **S**, a developer and recreational mathematician. I am properly addressed as *they, them, theirs.*

NB: I am in the process of changing my surname to **Lišková.** I have switched to using this name on most services. You may find a few stragglers under the last name **Malone**; that is also me.
