Hello! I'm **Sasha**, a developer and recreational mathematician.

I am properly addressed with *she*, *they*, or *xe/xyr* pronouns.

I strive to use GitHub as little as possible for reasons you should be able to divine. I use it primarily for contributing to other projects. You can find most of my own work over on [Sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~sverona) these days.
