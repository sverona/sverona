Hello! I'm **S**, a developer and recreational mathematician.

I am properly addressed with *she*, *they*, or *xe/xyr* pronouns.

I strive to use GitHub as little as possible for reasons you should be able to divine. You can find most of my work over on [Sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~sverona) these days.
